# CollegeProject
My college final year project. A Haskell tool similar to https://processing.org/.

# Current State
Unfortunately this was built against Haskell 98 8 years ago and is no longer working.
It depends on wxhaskell which seems complex to install on windows 10 at the time of writing.

# Outline
An ide script that creates a simple bare bones ide for haskell to create your graphics program.
A graphics library tooled for making it easy for people to create simple graphic programs, modelled on processing.org.
